I"œ<p>Begin first post. Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years agoâ€“<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>â€“having <a href="http://yahoo.com">little</a> or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to <a href="http://google.com">interest</a> me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>
